I do DoorDash to make some side money. I wanted to make a program to keep track of all the income 
and expenses made during my DoorDash adventures. I first made it into a Console application and it worked
great! 
I wanted to practice AspNet MVC and recreated the DDBusinessTracker into a website.
Maybe later i will add an account system for public use although idk about that hehe....


The one thing i didnt like is the this week bar. I duplicated the code to make it work on all pages 
but i know better than to duplicate code. :(







Use package console to create database
